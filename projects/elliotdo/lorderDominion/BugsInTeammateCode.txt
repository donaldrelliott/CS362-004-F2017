BUG 1

Title: Incorrect Treasure Card Count (Due to Adventurer)
Project: Dominion Card Game
Version: v1.0, Assignment 2 Refactored Code
Type: Bug
Status: Open
Priority: Major
Resolution: Not resolved
File name: dominion.c
Environments Tested In:	Flip ENGR server (gcc compiler)
                       	macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 (gcc compiler)

Description:		The error in this card occurs when the user
			has more than two treasure cards. It is
			easy to miss this one as correct numbers 
			will be reported if treasure cards are
			<= two.

Code Causing Bug: 	Line 1285. The while loop runs to
			drawntreasure<3, it should be terminating
			at 2 instead for the correct outputs.

Suggested Fix:		Change the value of 3 to 2.

BUG 2

Title: Incorrect Card Count (Due to Smithy)
Project: Dominion Card Game
Version: v1.0, Assignment 2 Refactored Code
Type: Bug
Status: Open
Priority: Major
Resolution: Not resolved
File name: dominion.c
Environment Tested In:  Flip ENGR server (gcc compiler)
                        macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 (gcc compiler)

Description:		The error in this card occurs whenever
			the smithy card is played. The hand
			count should be up by 2 (gain 3, discard
			1), but it only goes up 1.

Code causing Bug:	Line 1313. The for loop is off by one 
			digit. It should not be terminating at
			< 2.

Suggested Fix:		The line for(i=0; i<2, i++) should be 
			changed to for(i=0; i<3; i++).

BUG 3

Title: Incorrect Card Count (Due to Village)
Project: Dominion Card Game
Version: v1.0, Assignment 2 Refactored Code
Type: Bug
Status: Open
Priority: Major
Resolution: Not resolved
File name: dominion.c
Environment Tested In:  Flip ENGR server (gcc compiler)
                        macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 (gcc compiler)

Description:		The error in this card occurs whenever the
			village card is played. The actions are
			accurate, however it will not +1 a card.

Code causing Bug:	Line 1326. Commented out the line
			drawCard(currentPlayer, state), therefore it
			won't +1 a card as it is expected to do.

Suggested Fix:		Uncomment line 1327.
